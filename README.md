    * Frameworks used.
    * Tools used.
    * Defend your layout.

## Things to keep in mind:

* The site must be responsive.
* The use of frameworks and tools are of your consideration, although the weight and performance of the site will be evaluated with the lighthouse tool https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse. It will also be evaluated what frameworks and tools you choose for the job.
* The use of good practices, such as a class naming convention or clean and ordered code.
* The site will not be supported by Internet Explorer, but by Edge, Safary and other modern browsers. The use of cross browser rules will be evaluated.
