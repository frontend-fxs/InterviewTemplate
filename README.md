# Interview exercise (news site)

## Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to evaluate your layout skills.
For this, a simple news site will be created.

## Requirements:

* Only 2 pages are necessary:
* * A home page with a highlighted news item at the top plus news headlines grouped by category with links to the only detailed view of the news.
* * A second page that will be the detailed view of the news item.

### Elements common to both pages:

* A menu where all links will go to the detailed view of the news item. The first link and the site name (or logo) will be linked to the home page.
* A footer
* False Google ad placements that follow the size rules of Google ads. Where to place these ads will depend on you. https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7031480?hl=en

## Things to keep in mind:

* The content and titles will be fake because they are not important for the evaluation.
* The site must be responsive.
* The color palette of the site will be defined by you.
* You will choose which fonts from Google to use.
* You also will choose rights free images (if needed).
* The use of frameworks and tools are of your consideration, although the weight and performance of the site will be evaluated with the lighthouse tool. It will also be evaluated what frameworks and tools you choose for the job.
* The use of good practices, such as a class naming convention or clean and ordered code.
* The site will not be supported by Internet Explorer, but by Edge, Safary and other modern browsers. The use of cross browser rules will be evaluated.
